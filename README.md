# IAMSage: Interactive LLM-powered IAM Knowledge Base

## Project Vision

IAMSage is an AI-driven assistant designed to provide intelligent, context-aware answers to complex Identity and Access Management (IAM) questions. It leverages a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system to provide accurate information based on a curated knowledge base of documentation and best practices.

## Scope (MVP)

The initial Minimum Viable Product (MVP) will focus on delivering a core Q&A experience. It will answer user queries based on a small, manually selected set of high-quality IAM documents. The MVP will be deployed on a free hosting platform to validate the core concept without incurring costs.

## Development Roadmap

### Phase 1: MVP - Core LLM-powered Q&A

- **Week 1:** Project Setup & Data Ingestion
- **Week 2:** Local Embedding & Vector Store Creation (FAISS)
- **Week 3:** LLM Integration & Basic UI (Streamlit/Gradio)
- **Week 4:** Deployment to a Free Hosting Platform

### Phase 2: Expansion - Automated Data & Dynamic Experience

- **Week 5:** Automated Web Scraping for Data Ingestion
- **Week 6:** Migration to a Persistent Vector Database (ChromaDB/pgvector)
- **Future:** Enhanced UI/UX, Backend API, and advanced LLM integration.
